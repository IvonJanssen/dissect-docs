This part of the tutorial will introduce two fundamental concepts of Dissect: Targets and Records.
While you can definitely skip this section if you are in a hurry, we recommend that you go over this page to familiarize yourself
with these concepts as they will make the subsequent pages of the tutorial easier to follow.

This page assumes you have set up your system according to the instructions on :doc:`/tutorial/preparation`.

Context
-------

Since Dissect is aimed at forensic analysts and incident responders, the context of much of the tooling is analysis of
forensic artefacts. Whether they are stored on physical disks, disk images, virtual machines or other format, it is the goal
of Dissect to quickly get to the data that you need for your investigations.

Central to Dissect is the ``target-query`` tool, which is used to extract these artefacts. This tool takes as input "Targets" and
produces output called "Records". It is therefore important to know what these concepts are.

What you will learn in this section is:
- What are targets?
- What are records?
- How can I redirect records to other tools?

Note that this page only gives a handful of short examples to introduce you to these concepts. More elaborate examples of how to
use the tooling in practice are given in subsequent sections of this tutorial.
